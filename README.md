# zynq_ps_pl_bram
The experimental task of this chapter is that PS writes the data received by the serial port into BRAM, then reads the data from BRAM and prints it out through the serial port; at the same time, PL also reads the data from BRAM and observes the readout through ILA The data is consistent with the data printed by the serial port.
